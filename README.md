# finalproject

Please write your initial proposal for your final project in this README document. What type of project is it? 

- Package?
    - data package
    - analysis package
- Shiny app? 
- Something else?

Where do you expect to find data? Do you need help finding data? What question will your project answer or purpose will it solve?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our idea for the final project is an analysis package about starting salaries of undergraduates, and even more specifically computer science majors, from different universities in Minnesota. Payscale.com looks like a good starting point for our data.

We will look to find out which universities create higher valued graduates and whether this could possibly indicate a better computer science program. 

There is room for analysis on the difference between the salaries for graduates from different universities. We could look at how well computer science majors get paid vs the average graduate. Additionally we could look at whether certain school attributes like public vs. private or religious vs. nonreligious play a role in different graduates' salaries.
